# Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality Randomizer

If you're like me, and hundreds of thousands of people are, then you bought the recent itch.io bundle that had thousands of games in it for pennies on the dollar, and now you want to play some of them. But, which ones to play? There's too many! How to choose?!

Well, don't worry, let a random number generator choose for you!

## Features
 * Randomly choose a game from a list of 1700+
 * Filter based on the supposed platforms
 * Input your own bundle URL and it'll link you as close to the download as possible

## Known issues
 * There's no way to link directly to the downloads, due to how itch.io handles purchases. I did look into an API solution, but it's just not possible.
 * There isn't much information to filter on. Maybe additional metadata could be pulled in at build time?

## Acknowledgements
 * Obviously, all the contributers to the bundle itself made this happen in the first place. There are 1300+ unique authors, so I can't list them all here, but exposing the fruits of their labour is the whole point, so I hope this is okay!
 * itch.io is a fantastic service and the idea to put this bundle together in the first place is wonderful. Without them, this would not exist either, nor many of the games.
 * [Corey Dutson](https://twitch.tv/cdutson), my dear friend and streamer for whom I built this in the first place. I hope you find this useful!
